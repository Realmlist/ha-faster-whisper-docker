# ha-faster-whisper-docker
My HomeAssistant host's CPU is too old, so I want to host this on my docker server instead.

This image contains [faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper/) and the [The Wyoming Protocol](https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy3/blob/master/docs/wyoming.md) for communication with HomeAssistant

Based on [Home Assistant Add-on: Whisper](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/whisper)
